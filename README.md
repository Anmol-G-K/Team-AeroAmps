##  Key Highlights

| Feature                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Autonomy**             | Algorithms for autonomous navigation and flight control |
| **Modeling**             | Both linear & nonlinear drone dynamics are modeled |
| **Modular Design**       | Separated components for maintainability and clarity |
| **MATLAB & Simulink**    | Engineered using MathWorks tools, consistent with competition requirements |
| **Expandable**           | Easily extendable for future enhancements or new dron

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB (version 2024a/2024b or higher)
- Simulink (with relevant toolboxes <link>)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anmol-G-K/Team-AeroAmps.git
   cd Team-AeroAmps
    ```
2. **Open in MATLAB**
    - Double-click ```MinidroneCompetition.prj``` to launch the project, this will open the simulink model click on run and check for any errors
3. **Experiment & Iterate**
    - Tweak model parameters, control gains, or flight trajectories to suit your drone hardware or experiment setup.
